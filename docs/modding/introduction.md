Flamework is designed to be extensible and allows you to build upon the Flamework transformer which powers the default packages.

The majority of the Flamework transformer's behavior is exposed publicly, including, but not limited to:
* [Custom singletons](./guides/singletons.md)
* [Custom decorators](./guides/decorators.md)
* [Custom lifecycle events](./guides/lifecycle-events.md)
* [Type-based user macros](./guides/user-macros.md)
