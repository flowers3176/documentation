One of Flamework's goals is to be built upon.
A large majority of the systems used for Flamework internally are exposed publicly for users of Flamework to use.

This allows **you** to add new behavior to Flamework such as:
* Custom singletons
* Custom decorators
* Custom lifecycle events
* ...and so on
